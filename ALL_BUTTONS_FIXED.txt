## WHAT'S NEXT (NOT DEPENDENT ON FIREBASE)

These can be enhanced without Firebase:
1. Messages system (local chat interface)
2. Settings page (profile preferences)
3. Advanced notifications (filter by type)
4. Bulk operations (multiple file upload)
5. Export/Download functionality

Firebase will improve:
1. Data sync across devices
2. Real-time notifications
3. Cloud storage for files
4. Multi-user collaboration
5. Production database

## FIREBASE INTEGRATION NOTES

When Firebase is added later:

2. Add file upload to Firebase Storage
3. Enable real notifications
4. Add multi-user sync
5. But **buttons will still work the same way**

The button structure is Firebase-agnostic and ready for migration!
