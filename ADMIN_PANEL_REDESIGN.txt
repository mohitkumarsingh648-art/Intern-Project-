FIREBASE INTEGRATION READY
================================================================================

The task creation system is ready for Firebase integration. To add real backend:

1. In handleCreateTask() function
2. Replace console.log with:
   - db.collection('tasks').add({...})
   - Or: firebase.firestore().collection('tasks').add({...})

3. Add file upload to Firebase Storage:
   - db.collection('tasks').doc().collection('attachments').add(file)

4. Add success/error handling:
   - .then(docRef => showSuccess(...))
   - .catch(error => showError(...))

EXAMPLE FIREBASE CODE:
```javascript
db.collection('tasks').add({
    title: title,
    description: description,
    deadline: deadline,
    assignedTo: assignee,
    createdAt: firebase.firestore.Timestamp.now(),
    createdBy: currentUser.uid,
    status: 'active'
}).then(docRef => {
    console.log('Task created:', docRef.id);
    showSuccessMessage('Task created successfully!');
}).catch(error => {
    console.error('Error creating task:', error);
    showErrorMessage('Failed to create task');
});
```
