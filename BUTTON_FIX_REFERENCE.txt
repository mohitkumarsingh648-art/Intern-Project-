## ❌ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Will be fixed with Firebase)

- Data only stored locally (not synced to cloud)
- No file storage (files aren't actually saved)
- No real notifications (demo only)
- No multi-device sync

## ✅ READY FOR FIREBASE INTEGRATION

- All button structure is Firebase-agnostic
- localStorage can be swapped for Firestore
- Modal forms are ready for cloud storage
- No code changes needed to buttons

## 🎓 HOW BUTTONS WORK

### Before (Broken)
```javascript
<button onclick="alert('Coming soon')">Upload</button>
// Just shows alert, no page
```

### After (Fixed)
```javascript
<a href="../pages/upload-submission.html" class="btn">Upload</a>
// Opens real page with real form
```

**Last Updated:** November 15, 2025
